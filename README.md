This repository has a workflow of tests carried out to check **Probe Variability** and **ADC Variability** on Data acquisition and in creating Light weight IDS. We have used Probes from Digilent and "". For ADC's, we have chosen AD9467-FMC_250EBZ by Analog Devices. 

The experiment helps us understand how independent is the change in Probes and ADCs, by which we can answer, "What happens if we change probes or ADCs? will that show any change? or the system depneds on hardware for changes. We found out that ......

PS: Have to wait till the release :9 !
